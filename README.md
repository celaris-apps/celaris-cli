# Celaris CLI Tool

## Introduction

Celaris CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to streamline the development process of Celaris projects .

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 12 or higher recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

Install the cli:

```bash
npm install celaris-cli
```

## Usage


### Development Mode

To run the project in development mode, use the `dev` command. This command compiles and runs the project, and watches for any changes.

```bash
npm run celaris dev
```

You can also run the dev command without running a build command (handy on first run as the init command runs a build and test)

```bash
npm run celaris -- dev --no-build
```
